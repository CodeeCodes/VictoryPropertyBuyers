                Victory Property Buyers is here to help people who need to sell their home fast or are having
                trouble selling their home. Here are a list of more reasons why we could be the solution buyers
                to your current situation:</p>
            <ol class="faq__info-list">
                <li class="faq__info-list--item"> We can sell your house FAST. We can close on your schedule.</li>
                <li class="faq__info-list--item">We pay for your house in CASH! A cash offer simplifies real estate transactions
                    which leads to fewer complications and faster closing times. </li>
                <li class="faq__info-list--item"> We buy your house “AS-IS”, so no need for repairs, cleaning, or having to organize
                    time for people to walk through your house during showings.
                    You can even leave behind anything and we will take care of it for you!</li>
                <li class="faq__info-list--item"> Collect 100% of our cash offer with no hidden fees or commissions. Our service is
                    completely free and we also have an escrow company handle all the paperwork at no extra
                    cost to you either!</li>
                <li class="faq__info-list--item"> No need to involve lenders for your potential buyers. Traditional lenders can complicate
                    the process because they might not lend to buyers that have issues on the properties like title
                    issues or liens. They can also require a house inspection and appraiser to come to the property
                    and set requirements for you to fix before the lender will move forward. This back and forth can
                    end up costing you weeks or months of time before selling, not to mention more money out of your pocket.</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="faq__info-text">
                But some of the best reasons to work with us is that we are looking to help and find a win-win
                situation. Our goal is to best reach an offer that is both comfortable for you and also can make
                sense as an investment. More than that, we pride ourselves in helping you no matter what your
                situation. Even if we don’t find a solution between us, we can provide other solutions or people
                that may be the solution you are looking for. </p>
            <p class="faq__info-text">
                All in all, you should work with Victory Property Buyers because we are a caring, professional
                team that can help you find a solution for selling your house, no matter what your situation or
                time line, while keeping the process simple and easy for you. </p>

                We buy houses from all types of people for an array of reasons. One thing a majority of who we buy houses from has in common is that
                the seller is motivated to sell quickly.

            <h3 class="faq__info-heading">So Who We Are?</h3>
            <p class="faq__info-text">
                Victory Property Buyers is a respected, professional house buying service who have
                our own cash and are ready to buy! We are a home buying team that is here to help
                you sell your house fast, with no hassle or fees.
            </p>
            <p class="faq__info-text">
                After you get your cash fast, you get to walk away with no burden or payments to the property.
                We take on all the responsibility of bringing your house up to current market expectations
                through repairs and upgrades and sell it for a profit.
            </p>
            <p class="faq__info-text">
                Most of the homes we purchase are either distressed properties or are from motivate sellers.
                Remember you are exempt from the added costs a traditional realtor or traditional lender might
                require, like repairs and commission fees. Also, this adds time to the selling process,
                delaying you from receiving your money. We charge no fees or commission, but rather buy your
                house “as-is” so you can move on with your life and we do all the repairs and renovations
                before selling your house for a profit.
            </p>
            <p class="faq__info-text">
                Selling to us and giving you the freedom from the costs, repairs, and time it will take to
                bring your home up to its highest value, also helps your neighbors and your community.
                We bring a home up to its full potential with our own money, take on all the risks,
                and increase the value which in turns brings value to your neighborhood and your community.

        <div class="faq__info">
            <h3 class="faq__info-heading">How are you different than a Real Estate Agent?</h3>
            <p class="faq__info-text">
                We are different than a Real Estate Agent because we are not listing your house,
                we are actually buying your home. Real Estate Agents provide a great service if
                you can wait a long time to close, are willing to put in money for you to sell and
                prep the home for sale, and are willing to lose some of the final sale price to pay
                for their commission.
            </p>
            <p class="faq__info-text">
                Here is a list of the benefits when selling to us over a Real Estate Agent:
            </p>

            <div class="faq__div">
                <div class="faq__div--flex">
                    <ul class="faq__list">
                        <li class="faq__info-list--item">Because we are interested right in the beginning and have the
                            ability to close with cash quickly, we saves you weeks or months on closing your sale and
                            getting your money.</li>
                        <li class="faq__info-list--item">Because we buy your house as is, you don’t have to go through
                            the lengthy and costly steps of selling your home.
                            With a Real Estate Agent, you will be responsible for fixing repairs,
                            cleaning, staging, having showings, hiring photographers, and other tasks
                            most Real Estate Agents will require of you before putting your house on the market.</li>
                        <li class="faq__info-list--item">There are no hassles dealing with negotiations and wasting
                            time waiting for loan qualifications from buyers. You can see your money in as quick as
                            a week.</li>
                        <li class="faq__info-list--item">You don’t have to pay the high prices of realtor commissions
                            and fees. This means more money back into your pocket! Often times between the agent for
                            the buyer and the agent for the seller, you will have to sacrifice 5-6% of the sale price
                            of your house. (To put that in perspective, if your home is worth $500,000 you will have
                            to pay around $25,000-$30,000 in commissions.)</li>
                        <li class="faq__info-list--item">With a Real Estate Agent, you are confined by contract to work
                            with this person. If your work relationship changes even within the first few weeks, you
                            are bound by a contact to continue to work with a person for several months on end to sell
                            your home. We are easy, friendly, and pleasant to work with and work with you on such a
                            short timeline that you don’t have to worry about a business relationship going wrong.</li>
                        <li class="faq__info-list--item">With a Realtor, you have to compete time and attention with
                            many other sellers and buyers they are working with at the same time.
                            You want to be the focus when selling your home, but the agent has a major list of
                            sellers and buyers they are working with. Not being Real Estate Agents with numerous
                            amounts of clients, we can give you our undivided attention to help you with your unique
                            selling situation. </li>

            <p class="faq__info-text">
                It’s important for you to understand how we come up with a fair, cash offer.
                But more importantly, we want to clarify we are willing to buy your property
                no matter its condition or no matter why you want to sell. These will just be
                the factors that we consider when coming up with our cash offer of your home.
            </p>
            <p class="faq__info-text">
                Our cash offer system is a proven, practiced method to give you a cash offer on your
                home’s real property value. We have this estimation system down to a science and can
                give you a fair cash offer sometimes in just a few hours.

            <p class="faq__info-text">
                Here are the things we factor in to our fair cash offer:

                Once we can determine the “post-renovation” value after we do the repairs,
                we can make you a cash offer that works for us and can work for you too.
